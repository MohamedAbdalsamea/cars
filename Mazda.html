Mazda changed its car logo four times before choosing its current design in the market, designed in 1997, which represents the first letter of the company’s name (M) drawn in an aesthetic way resembling two hands extended and raised to the sky looking to the future, with an implicit reference to the religious dimension of the name Mazda.
