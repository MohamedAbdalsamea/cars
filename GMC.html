     <h4 class="nnnn">In 1901, a company called the Express Car Company was founded, which pioneered the design of commercial trucks, using single-cylinder vehicles. In 1906, the company, which was purchased by General Motors, formed the basis for the General Motors truck, from which GMC derived its truck. The GMC truck was first launched in 1912, producing 22,000 trucks that year, and making its debut at the New York International Auto Show, although GMC contributed only 372 units. In 1962, GMC trucks crossed the country from Seattle to New York City in thirty days. During World War II, GMC produced 600,000 trucks for use by the U.S. military.</h4>
