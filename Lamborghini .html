     <h1 class="car">information about Lamborghini</h1>
     <h4 class="nnnn">Italian manufacturing magnate Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the goal of producing a large luxury car to compete with offerings from marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were launched in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini is best known for the 1966 Miura sports coupe, which used a mid-rear engine and rear wheels. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales declined following the global financial downturn of 1973 and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer, who retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed under receivership by brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans family bought the company out of receivership in 1984 and invested heavily in its expansion. Under Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Hala sports car and the LM002 high-performance off-road vehicle.</h4>
